	 *  What is Recursion ?
	 *  
	 *  - Repeatation of same function done with same inputs but with different data
	 */
   
	/*
	 *  when to use recursion in coding interview?
	 *  - Divide and conquer problems !!
	 *  - You are not supposed to use loop !!
	 *  - The number of lines are small !!
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  What about O Notations?
	 *  - Greater than O(n)
	 *  
	 *  Resolve to solve the problem with recursion
	 *  
	 *  1) Identify the simplest / smallest possible input(	Base case)
	 *  2) Build the test data to visualize
	 *  3) Break harder cases to simple cases
	 *  4) Generalize the pattern
	 *  5) Finally, write the code to combine the pattern
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  Finally, Why  QAE / SDET learn recursion
	 *  Easy / Medium
	 *  Trees/graphs are only asked in companies like netflex, meta, google.
